# Tindog
# Tindog is an online dating website built by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. As we all know that there are different sites used for online dating and Tinder is one of the top leading brands amongst all. But sadly it is only for humans and not for pets and this is where tindog comes into play. It is a website which is made for the dogs to find their loved one
# The website layout is simple and is beginner-friendly. Since the website is built using the frontend tools, the website is static and not dynamic. The webiste contains three sections:
# 1) Contact Section:- This section is used for contacting the website owner for any query. 
# 2) Pricing Section:- Since the app is not free, it has 3 plans to suit the needs of the user. The user can choose any plan among the 3 for their pet dog.
# 3) Download Section:- The third and the last section contains the link for downloading the app. The application can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store.
# In contrast to the above features, the website also contains the Testimonial Section, where some past experiences from the dogs have been added.
